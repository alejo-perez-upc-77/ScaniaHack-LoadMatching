# Historical Fleet Data for Load Matching Problem

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the key considerations for utilizing historical fleet data in the context of load matching between shippers and carriers. Load matching involves pairing shipments from shippers with available carrier capacity efficiently and effectively. Historical fleet data plays a crucial role in optimizing this process.

## Data Sources

1. **Carrier Data**: Information about carrier fleets, including vehicle types, capacities, geographical coverage, and historical performance metrics.
2. **Shipper Data**: Details about shipment characteristics such as weight, volume, dimensions, pickup and delivery locations, and delivery deadlines.
3. **Historical Transaction Data**: Records of past load assignments, including successful matches, rejections, cancellations, and any associated feedback or performance metrics.

## Key Considerations

1. **Data Quality**: Ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the historical fleet data to prevent biases and errors in load matching algorithms.
2. **Granularity**: Determine the appropriate level of granularity for analysis, considering factors like time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly), geographical regions, and specific vehicle types.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the data, such as route distances, transit times, vehicle utilization rates, and past performance indicators.
4. **Normalization and Scaling**: Normalize numerical features and scale data to ensure fair comparisons and optimal model performance.
5. **Missing Data Handling**: Implement strategies to handle missing data, such as imputation techniques or excluding incomplete records while preserving data integrity.
6. **Outlier Detection**: Identify and address outliers in the data, which may skew load matching results or indicate anomalies in carrier performance.
7. **Temporal Patterns**: Analyze temporal trends in fleet capacity and shipment demand to anticipate seasonal fluctuations, peak periods, and other time-sensitive factors.
8. **Spatial Analysis**: Consider spatial factors such as traffic congestion, route restrictions, and regional demand patterns when matching loads with available carrier capacity.
9. **Predictive Modeling**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to forecast future demand, predict carrier availability, and optimize load assignment decisions based on historical fleet data.
10. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop mechanism to continuously refine load matching algorithms based on real-time performance data and user feedback.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleanse, preprocess, and prepare historical fleet data for analysis, ensuring compatibility with load matching algorithms.
2. **Model Development**: Develop and train load matching models using historical fleet data, incorporating relevant features and considering business objectives and constraints.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of load matching models using historical transaction data, measuring metrics such as match accuracy, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Iterate on model development and refinement based on performance feedback, data updates, and evolving business requirements.
